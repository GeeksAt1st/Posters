# Posters for other clubs

We help other clubs to make posters. These are and they also licensed under [CC-BY-SA 3.0 International](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0).

## Clubs We Helped

  * Model United Nations (模联社)
  * ShiYe Debate Club (拾叶辩论社)

## Terms We Help Other Clubs

Of course we are glad to help other clubs to make posters, and we have 2 plans:

  - Free, and all posters published under [CC-BY-SA 3.0 International](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0) (posters are shown here), copyright holder is us.
  - Proprietary, and you're the copyright holder. But we require a logo of our club on the poster.

Optionally, we can offer printing service. If so, we will collect the cost of printing. But if choosing plan 2, we will collect 15% extra money as "service charge".
