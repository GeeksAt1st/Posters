We help other clubs to make posters. These are and they also licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0 CN.

Terms We Help Other Clubs
=========================

Of course we are glad to help other clubs to make posters, and we have 2 plans:

  - Free, and all posters published under CC-BY-SA 3.0 (posters are shown here);
  - Proprietary, but we require a logo of our club on the poster;

Optionally, we can offer printing service. If so, we will collect the cost of printing. But if choosing plan 2, we will collect 15% extra money as "service charge".
